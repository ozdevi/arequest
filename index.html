        <h1>Hello, user!</h1>
        <p>This website will be built on top of your requests. Each request is a brick and we can start a construction with them. So this is really under construction. Go bring a brick!</p>
        <h2>Where can I put my bricks?</h2>
        <p>Good question. Maybe we need some sort of stockpile when we have many bricks! Until then, you can send your brick via email: <a href="mailto:sendmybrick@gmail.com">sendmybrick@gmail.com</a></p>
        <h3>Bricks (To-do list):</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><s>Add under construction gif &mdash; me</s></li>
            <li>Seriously need a stockpile (form/database) to save the bricks! &mdash; me</li>
            <li><q>Here is my brick! Turn those goddamn bullets into checkboxes.</q> &mdash; <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gulp">@gulp</a></li>
        </ul>
