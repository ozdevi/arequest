# User Bricks
### A website built by user requests from scratch.

Hello, user!
This website will be built on top of your requests. Each request is a brick and we can start a construction with them. So this is really under construction. Go bring a brick!

### Where can I put my bricks?
Good question. Maybe we need some sort of stockpile when we have many bricks! Until then, you can send your brick via email: sendmybrick@gmail.com
